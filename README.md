# ultimate-instagram-bot
i created this about 4 years ago so the code probaly dosent work as instagram changes their layout after each update , made with selenium python and chrome webdriver
and this is total chaos so i even dont know what was doing at that time i also dont bother fixing it or updating it anymore but i scanned over what i wrote and i had 1-50 files titeled "1.py","2.py"... "50.py"
with code 
```python

import nothing

nothing.nothingness('account_name','password',"8")
```
with account name and password being the account name and password . i had about 50 of these running 

functionability:
it could get fdollowers list of an account message each of the followers with a cusotm pre text and wait  it was anti detection from intragram,
it also had a function to post random meemes from reddit, 

but as i said total chaos i have given up on it , cause the code written would be a crime if someone saw it
